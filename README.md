Read the documentation for more information.
- [Documentation (English)](https://twikit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/twikit.html)
- [Async Documentation](https://twikit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/twikit.twikit_async.html)

## Features
### No API Key Required
The library uses an unofficial API and therefore does **not require an API key**.
### Completely Free
The service is entirely free to use.
### Both Synchronous and Asynchronous Support
Whether you prefer **synchronous** or **asynchronous** programming,
Twikit supports both, providing flexibility for different use cases.

## Functionality
This library allows you to perform various Twitter-related actions, including:
- **Create tweets**
- **Search tweets**
- **Retrieve trending topics**
- etc...

## Installing
 ```back
 pip install twikit
 ```

## Quick Example
**Define a client and log in to the account.**
```python
from twikit import Client

USERNAME = 'example_user'
EMAIL = 'email@example.com'
PASSWORD = 'password0000'

# Initialize client
client = Client('en-US')
# Login to the service with provided user credentials
client.login(
    auth_info_1=USERNAME ,
    auth_info_2=EMAIL,
    password=PASSWORD
)
```
**Create a tweet with media attached.**
```python
# Upload media files and obtain media_ids
media_ids = [
    client.upload_media('media1.jpg', index=0),
    client.upload_media('media2.jpg', index=1)
]
# Create a tweet with the provided text and attached media
client.create_tweet(
    text='Example Tweet',
    media_ids=media_ids
)
```
